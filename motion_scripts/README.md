- **motion.conf**  
  In the Pi it can be found in this path: ```/etc/motion/motion.conf.json```

  This file has been modified to take snapshots every 60 seconds and make sure the images are save in the correct path.

- **control_ON_lights.py** and **control_OFF_light.py**  
  In the Pi they can be found in these paths:
