# Try to turn on your Raspberry Pi every hour sharp.
# This script doesn't schedule the shutdown, which is supposed to be done externally.
# You can shutdown your Raspberry Pi with your program just after finishing the job.
#
# [Tips]
# Although the ON state is marked as 1 minute, its actual duration may vary.
# The OFF state will end exactly 60 minutes after your RPi gets turned on.
